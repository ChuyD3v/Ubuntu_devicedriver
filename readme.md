# Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Access Kernel Driver for Linux 


## Introduction 

## Compiling 

Install dependencies before compilation: (following command is for debian, use the respective package manager for your distro)

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) kmod
```

The Makefile provided in the files. Use the command `make` to build the driver file. 

Use `make clean` for cleaning the project repository with all the files generated with `make` command. 

After compilation, `gpio_driver.ko` file would be generated, which is the Kernel Object file. 

## Loading the Driver 

To load the driver into the Kernel, use the following command:

```
sudo insmod gpio_driver.ko
```

This will load the driver into the Kernel. For ensuring the driver is connected properly, verify it by these two commands:

```
sudo lsmod 
```

```
sudo dmesg
```

If the driver is loaded, it will be listed by the `lsmod` command. It is also recommended to check the output of the `dmesg` command. The `dmesg` prints the content of the Kernel Buffer which contains logs of messages generated by the drivers loaded into the kernel.
